    SAY ~Of all people, I identify with druids the most.  They understand the need for solitude, what can be learnt from silence and contemplation and careful consideration.  Nature is a powerful and wondrous thing, and they understand its importance in the grand scheme of things.  I feel that they do more good than a lot of people, especially those who give no thought to what they kill.~

  IF ~~ berserkers
    SAY ~I can identify with the rage they justify themselves with, but I don't think it is the correct way to channel rage.  Some berserkers believe that their rage is the most pure emotion, and in a way, I can see what they mean; but I do not think that it is the best and most efficient way to do battle.~

  IF ~~ magic
    SAY ~Magic?  Is not each day a work of magic, <CHARNAME>?  There are so many different forms of magic, and yet you limit yourselves to one.  I believe magic is a very powerful force, and it can do great things.  But it can also do great evil, and corrupt.~ = ~So in retrospect, I'm in two minds about what *you* term as magic.  On one hand, it can be a force of great good and great evil, but on the other, it cheapens the miracles of every day.  Childbirth, life, death--these are miracles which occur constantly, and yet we do not regard them as such, because we are so preoccupied with the idea of magic.~ = ~Is that a good thing?  You tell me.~

    SAY ~I do not agree with the idea of someone using a lockpick to enter a house uninvited, but I believe sometimes such a skill is necessary to one's survival.  While I may not agree with a thieve's doctrine, they can be useful, when the situation calls for it.~
