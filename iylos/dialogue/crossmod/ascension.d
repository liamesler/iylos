  == IRENIC2 ~Your puny defiance is of no moment, monk.  Go back to your pathetic witterings, and leave the true conversation to the adults.~
  == IRENIC2 ~You *will* succumb, <CHARNAME>, and fall, just as I once did.~

  == LK#IYLJ IF ~InParty("Iylos") InMyArea("Iylos") !StateCheck("Iylos",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~You cannot truly believe she will attain her goal, do you, brother?~
  == BALTH2  ~I no longer retain that title, Iylos.  I renounced it as soon as I sent you to watch <CHARNAME>.~
  == LK#IYLJ ~I--~
  == BALTH2  ~No, Iylos.  This is not the time, nor the place for this conversation.  This may not be the end of the world, but it is the end of *our* world, and we must fight to preserve it!~
  == BALTH2  ~Quickly, <CHARNAME>--we must cut off her power source as soon as we can, or I fear she will gain the power she craves.~

  == LK#IYLJ IF ~InParty("Iylos") InMyArea("Iylos") !StateCheck("Iylos",CD_STATE_NOTVALID)~ THEN ~You need no longer imagine, brother; for a creature of such beauty would not lie.  You are are mortal, brother.  What will you do now?~
  == BALTH2  ~I know not.  I...I will return to Amkethran, perhaps. Beyond that, we will see.  And I--you should not call me brother, after what I said to you.~
  == LK#IYLJ ~It is of no moment, brother.~
  == BALTH2  ~Then hush, Iylos.  There is yet more to be said here.~
